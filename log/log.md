**mindmap** - The choice of using mindmap now only apply to lecture content since it does not work really in for papers as they are already quite concise.

how many **papers** per week - reddit threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/7ebwjp/how_many_papers_do_you_read_per_week_and_what_is/

> Assist Prof - I read about 30-50 or so abstracts a week and then fully read maybe 5-15 of those a week. When I'm starting a project, writing a paper or a grant, those numbers go way up. This is just baseline "keeping up with the field."

``mindmap`` is good for overview, but still need to write down in ``sequential`` manner for detailed undestanding.

**marked.** 2023.1.3 - if I didnt push commits to here, I did not read papers or only a little bit.

For **detailed read**, rather retype e.g. the formula to understand better than just skip; can learn some latex on the way as well.

Thinking if I cannot make it clear here to summarise the paper then prob I did not understand it properly.



2023 resolution: consistency, progressive descent

\#quality-of-paper if have code and openreview, high quality paper, especially code with great comments +1M thumbs up
